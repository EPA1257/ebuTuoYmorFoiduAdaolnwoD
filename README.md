# ebuTuoYmorFoiduAdaolnwoD
very very simple VBS program for downloading audio from youtube/anything else that works with youtube-dl

as long as you have youtube-dl and ffmpeg installed through python (or as exe files in the folder with this script)

i wrote this for a class i am in, so we can grab audio from ebutuoy if things aren't available through spotify or whatever.

aaaaanywwaaaays

download <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/releases"youtube-dl</a> here and <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/"ffmpeg</a> here.
